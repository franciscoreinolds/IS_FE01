1st Assignment - Semantics Interoperabity ( IS )

## Objective

Create two systems capable of communicating via the HL7 protocol, extensively used in today's medical field as a way of transmitting patient's records and exams.

As a result, we created two webapps, in which we allow the insertion of several differennt kinds of medical related messages as consultations, requiring exams, among others, and we make use of Mirth Connect to intercept those messages and storing them into a DB, thus persisting the data.
